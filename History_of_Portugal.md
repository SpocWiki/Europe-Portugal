> The history of Portugal can be traced from circa 400,000 years ago, 
> when the region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by Homo heidelbergensis.
>
> The Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, which lasted almost two centuries, 
> led to the establishment of the provinces of Lusitania in the south 
> and Gallaecia in the north of what is now Portugal. 
> 
> Following the fall of Rome, 
> Germanic tribes controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries, 
> including the Kingdom of the Suebi centred in Braga and the Visigothic Kingdom in the south.
>
> The 711–716 invasion by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate 
> conquered the Visigoth Kingdom and founded the Islamic State of Al-Andalus, 
> gradually advancing through Iberia. 
> 
> In 1095, Portugal broke away from the Kingdom of Galicia.  
> Afonso Henriques, son of the count Henry of Burgundy, 
> proclaimed himself king of Portugal in 1139. 
> 
> The Algarve was re-conquered from the Moors in 1249, and in 1255 Lisbon became the capital. 
> Portugal's land boundaries have remained almost unchanged since then. 
> 
> During the reign of King John I, 
> the Portuguese defeated the Castilians in a war over the throne (1385) 
> and established a political alliance with England (by the Treaty of Windsor in 1386).
>
> From the late Middle Ages, in the 15th and 16th centuries, 
> Portugal ascended to the status of a world power during Europe's "Age of Discovery" 
> as it built up a vast empire. 
> 
> Signs of military decline began with the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in Morocco in 1578; 
> this defeat led to the death of King Sebastian and the imprisonment of much of the high nobility, 
> which had to be ransomed at great cost. 
> 
> This eventually led to a small interruption in Portugal's 800-year-old independence 
> by way of a 60-year dynastic union with Spain between 1580 
> and the beginning of the Portuguese Restoration War led by John IV in 1640. 
> 
> Spain's disastrous defeat in its attempt to conquer England in 1588 
> by means of the Invincible Armada was also a factor, 
> as Portugal had to contribute ships for the invasion. 
> 
> Further setbacks included the destruction of much of its capital city in an earthquake in 1755, 
> occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the loss of its largest colony, Brazil, in 1822. 
> 
> From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, 
> nearly two million Portuguese left Portugal to live in Brazil and the United States.
>
> In 1910, a revolution deposed the monarchy. A military coup in 1926 installed a dictatorship that remained until another coup in 1974. The new government instituted sweeping democratic reforms and granted independence to all of Portugal's African colonies in 1975. Portugal is a founding member of NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. It entered the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1986.
